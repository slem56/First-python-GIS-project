# First-python-GIS-project

This is my first GIS project in python and first time using geopandas.  
I followed this youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsSEKm-rU6U  
Github repository of the example in the video: https://github.com/christyheaton/PyCon2018_GISTutorial

#### Goal
My personal goal was to learn new skills in python and its GIS modules.  
The project goal was to find the solar eclipse that passed over the most people and map the 5 most populated cities in the eclipse.  

#### The data I used was:	
- The eclipse shapefile from the original repository
- The city csv (as I wanted to use multiple types of data formats) from here: https://simplemaps.com/data/world-cities
- The naturalearth_lowres map from the geopandas datasets
